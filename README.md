# Web Dev Projects
This will be the home for all of my web development projects from my udemy 50 projects in 50 days course.
My current plan is to knock out one of these assignments a day, in conjuction with a section from my introduction to web development course. 
As of starting this repository I am just over halfway through the intro to web dev course. So I have a base understanding of most web front end web development concepts.

##Project 1 - Expanding Cards
Description - A simple project where a main card is active and takes up a majority of the page. As you click on the other smaller cards, they will grow to the size of the page and the previously active one will shrink.
